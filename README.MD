# gulp config for email templation

Hi! This is my gulp config for email templating.

## How to use
```
yarn install
yarn start
```
All your base code is in `src` directory. There are `ejs` module for better html coding and `sass` module for easy css. Also you can use mocks from mocks directory - `ejs` parse all to needed format. Directory `/dist/images/email/` for images in your email.

## Happy hacking!
